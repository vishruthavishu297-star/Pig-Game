Pig Game
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The Pig Game is a browser-based two-player dice game where players roll a virtual dice to accumulate points. The game includes dynamic UI updates, turn switching, score tracking, and event-driven gameplay using JavaScript. Users can roll the dice, hold their score, and reset the game. The logic also handles conditions like rolling a 1, switching players, and checking for a winner. The project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive game design.
